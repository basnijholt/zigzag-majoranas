\setheader{Preface}

When I started my thesis, I had been out of the quantum physics world for a year and a half, and, to be honest, did not remember much.
This meant that I had many basic questions for which I was quite embarrassed that I had the need to ask.
I was very fortunate to have Bas as a supervisor, who always answered my questions -- however basic -- without making me feel stupid.
It is quite a rare quality in our little bubble: where we all want to show how smart we are.
Apart from that personal note, I am also greatly appreciative to the in-depth support and feedback Bas has provided me: I received a great deal of support in programming, writing, and giving comments on my thesis.
I am also very grateful for setting up the meeting with Anna Keselman, the co-author of the main paper relevant to my thesis, which was very helpful for my understanding.

I would also like to thank Anton and Michael for all the help and discussions, even when I wanted to discuss ideas so vague that the term handwaving sounds too specific.
It was during one of these discussions that I got the suggestion that long trajectories cause a soft gap, which ultimately led to the idea of the zigzag geometry.
I am also very grateful for the opportunities I received to meet and present for researchers in our field outside of the group.

In no particular order, I would like to thank:
Piotr and Sybren for the interesting discussions we had, as well as a fun office atmosphere,
Joe for the many times you helped me with coding, Pablo for answering many questions and KPM, Daniel for helping me with QSymm, TÃ³mas for helping me go through the hell known as scattering matrices, and Srijit, Fokko and Qing for the interesting discussions we had, and kick-ass SEM photographs.

I am also eternally grateful for the creation of Kwant: my favorite quantum physics sandbox.
Using Kwant, I was able to go from idea to implementation to simulation within a matter of hours.
It is truly amazing, and I know for sure that I would have never tried weirdly shaped junctions without it. 

I would also like to thank my girlfriend Irina, for proofreading my thesis, and the detailed comments I received.
I am also very grateful for all the support she gave me, especially in the beginning, when it was quite frustrating, and at the end, when I was stressed.

Finally, I would like to thank my family, who have been extremely supportive of me.
I am especially grateful for them providing a home where I can always come to rest.
