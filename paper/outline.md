# Introduction
* Setup
** Straight and zigzag (zz) system, with trajectories

# Analytical estimate
Quasi classical short junction calculation
<!-- no figures -->

# Numerical bandstructures
* Bandstructures
** For phi, B = (0, 0), (Ï€, B) in one subplot with different colors
   for all different systems z_y = [0, somewhat good, very good]

* Phase diagrams of straight vs zz (using Bas' algo) + gap using min(bands(k))
** mu vs B
** phase vs B

# Localization lengths and shape effect
* Wavefunctions plot, for different sizes, shapes
** straigh system wf (majo_length = long) + topological gap
** zz system wf (majo_length = 0) + topological gap
** sine system wf (majo_length = 0) + topological gap
** Laeven shape wf (majo_length = 0) + topological gap
