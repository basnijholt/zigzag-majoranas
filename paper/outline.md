# Abstract
We are solving a problem of soft gap in high density SNS Majorana junctions.
We do this by introducing a zigzag geometry.
This works because the maximum trajactory length is cut-off due to the geomerty and therefore the minimal energy gap is given by a simple formula, which we also verify using numerics.
In addition to having a large minimum energy gap, the abscence of long length trajectories means that the localization length is very short as well.

# Introduction
* Setup
** Straight and zigzag (zz) system, with trajectories

# Analytical estimate
Quasi classical short junction calculation
<!-- no figures -->

# Numerical bandstructures
* Bandstructures
** For phi, B = (0, 0), (Ï€, B) in one subplot with different colors
   for all different systems z_y = [0, somewhat good, very good]

* Phase diagrams of straight vs zz (using Bas' algo) + gap using min(bands(k))
** mu vs B
** phase vs B

# Localization lengths and shape effect
* Wavefunctions plot, for different sizes, shapes
** straigh system wf (majo_length = long) + topological gap
** zz system wf (majo_length = 0) + topological gap
** sine system wf (majo_length = 0) + topological gap
** Laeven shape wf (majo_length = 0) + topological gap
