H = H_kinetic - chem_potential +
	spin_orbit + zeeman + superconductivity
	
Calculate whether topological by pfaffian:
	show plot
calculate gap:
	using diagonalization
	using band
calculate bands
calculate current by kpm, or full spectrum
	- wraparound

idea of anton:
	Zeeman in plane effect on 3d lattice
