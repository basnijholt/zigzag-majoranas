All of the paper's plots are generated with `paper-figures.ipynb` using functions defined in `zigzag.py`.

The notebook contains instructions of how it can be used.

# Data
Download the data used in `paper-figures.ipynb` at http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2578027 and place it in a directory called `data/`. If the data is missing, use the code in the notebook to generate it.

# Installation
Install [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) and then the Python
